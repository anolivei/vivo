# Processo_Seletivo_Vivo_42

Learning Python, sorry for this, I just did the first one exercise...

bitmap and bitmap_args are simple functions which returns the frequency of the numbers (defined in a vetor A[x]) in a matrix

1. bitmap 
works with the parameters vector and matrix defined into the function main <br>
to use:
- define the vector A[x] with the numbers which you want to investigate (line 25)
- define the matrix (line 27)
- type 
```
python bitmap.py
```

2. bitmap_args works with the parameters vector and matrix passed as arguments <br>
to use:
- type
```
python bitmap_arg.py A[x] M[m][n]
```
- example: 
```
python bitmap_args.py [1,4,6] [[1,1,2,4,5,6],[2,4,1,6,5,7]]
```

Requirements: python 3.7 <br>
              numpy
